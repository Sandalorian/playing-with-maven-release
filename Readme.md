# Playing With Maven Release Plugin

The aims of this test is are to deploy a trivial Java application to Github releases. 

The release process will use [Maven Release plugin](https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/index.html) combined with Github Actions. 

The [Maven Release plugin](https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/index.html) is used because it will automatically adjust the pom.xml project.version and commit the changes.
